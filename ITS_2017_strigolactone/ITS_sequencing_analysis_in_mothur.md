##                               ITS sequencing data analysis using mothur

---
Data set comes from 2017 strigolactone project, with RNAi, Over-expression and GR24 restore treatments
---

**Target region**: ITS2 by ITS3_F and ITS4_R, for arrangement and primer choice of ITS1 and ITS2 please refer [PacBio metabarcoding of Fungi and other eukaryotes: errors,biases and perspectives](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/nph.14776) for more information.

## Analysis process

1) Transfer data to staton server
2) Download UNITE reference follower [UNITE souce](https://unite.ut.ee/repository.php)
3) Come up with reasonable strategy for this data analysis.
